<p>
You can inline JavaScript in the href attribute, (you have to prefix the code with `javascript:`).
I was in disbelieve when I discovered this.
I don't know why anyone would ever use this feature instead of, ya know a button?
But now you know you can.
The pain in the ass implication of this is that users can post dangerous "links" that can run JavaScript on other clients.

If you don't believe me click the example below.
</p>
<br/>

<a href="javascript:alert(`Hello world`)"> Alert example </a>
<br/>

<div>

```html
<a href="javascript:alert(`Hello world`)"> 
  Alert example 
</a>
```

</div>
